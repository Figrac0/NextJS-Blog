## Overview

Express Shop is a production-like e-commerce application built with Node.js and Express using a classic MVC architecture and server-side rendering (EJS).

The project focuses on real backend concerns that matter in typical commerce flows:

- secure authentication and sessions
- persistent cart and order history
- payments via Stripe Checkout
- invoice PDFs generated on demand and streamed to the browser
- CSRF protection for forms and destructive requests

## Key Features

- Product management (create, update, delete) with image upload
- Authentication: signup, login, logout, password reset via email
- Session-based authorization with server-side sessions stored in MongoDB
- User cart stored per account (add, remove, clear)
- Stripe Checkout payments
- Orders persistence with immutable product snapshots
- PDF invoice generation on demand (streamed to browser and stored on disk)
- CSRF protection for forms and secure DELETE requests via fetch()
- Server-side rendering with EJS templates

## Tech Stack

Backend and SSR:

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS

Database:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose (ODM)

Security and auth:

- express-session + connect-mongodb-session (session store in MongoDB)
- csurf (CSRF protection)
- bcryptjs (password hashing)
- express-validator (validation + sanitization)
- connect-flash (auth feedback messages)

Payments and documents:

- Stripe Checkout (hosted payment pages)
- pdfkit (invoice generation)

Uploads and email:

- multer (image uploads to local storage)
- nodemailer + SendGrid transport (transactional email for signup and password reset)

## Architecture

The application follows MVC:

- Routes – define endpoints and middleware chain
- Controllers – implement request handling, business logic, and view rendering
- Models – MongoDB schemas and domain methods (cart logic on User)
- Views – EJS templates rendered on the server

Typical request flow:

```js
// route -> middleware -> controller -> model -> view
router.post("/add-product", isAuth, validators, adminController.postAddProduct);
```

## Environment Configuration

Configuration is loaded via dotenv:

```js
require("dotenv").config();
// Loads process.env.MONGO_USER, process.env.STRIPE_SECRET, etc.
```

You keep secrets out of Git and configure them per environment (local, staging, production).

Expected env vars (based on code usage):

```text
MONGO_USER
MONGO_PASSWORD
MONGO_CLUSTER
MONGO_DB
STRIPE_SECRET
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
API_KEY (SendGrid)
DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME (Sequelize/MySQL module exists but MongoDB is the core)
```

## Database Layer – MongoDB + Mongoose

### Why MongoDB here

MongoDB fits well for:

- flexible document modeling for carts and orders
- nested structures (user.cart.items)
- fast iteration without rigid schema migrations
- natural representation of product snapshots inside orders

### Mongoose responsibilities

- Define schemas and constraints (required fields, types)
- Provide model API (find, findById, save, deleteOne)
- Enable references via ObjectId (relations-like behavior with populate)
- Allow instance methods for business logic (cart methods on User)

## Core Domain Models

### Product model

Each product belongs to a user (owner/creator) via userId reference.

```js
const productSchema = new Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    price: { type: Number, required: true },
    description: { type: String, required: true },
    imageUrl: { type: String, required: true },
    userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true },
});
```

This enables authorization checks like “only owner can edit/delete”.

### User model and cart logic

Cart is stored inside the user document:

```js
items: [{ productId, quantity }];
```

Instance methods encapsulate cart operations:

```js
userSchema.methods.addToCart = function (product) {
    // Finds item in cart and increments quantity or inserts new item
    // Ensures cart logic stays close to the data model
    return this.save();
};
```

This is a strong design choice: cart invariants and updates remain consistent.

### Order model

Orders store:

- user info (email + userId)
- purchased products as immutable snapshots

```js
products: [
    {
        product: { type: Object, required: true },
        quantity: { type: Number, required: true },
    },
];
```

Storing product as a plain object snapshot prevents historical inconsistency if a product title/price changes later.

## Sessions, Cookies, and Authentication

### express-session + connect-mongodb-session

Authentication state is stored server-side in MongoDB (sessions collection). The browser only holds the session id cookie.

```js
app.use(
    session({
        secret: "my secret",
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: false,
        store,
    }),
);
```

Key points:

- Cookie identifies a session, not a user directly
- Session store persists across server restarts
- Server controls session invalidation

### Password hashing – bcryptjs

Passwords are never stored in plaintext. On signup:

```js
bcrypt.hash(password, 12); // 12 rounds is a standard secure baseline
```

On login:

```js
bcrypt.compare(password, user.password); // constant-time compare
```

## Validation and Sanitization – express-validator

Requests are validated at the route level, before entering controller logic.

Example for product creation:

```js
body("price")
  .customSanitizer(v => String(v).replace(",", "."))
  .isFloat(),
```

This does two things:

- normalizes decimal separators (EU comma vs dot)
- enforces numeric correctness

Controllers then check:

```js
const errors = validationResult(req);
if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    // re-render view with errorMessage and validationErrors
}
```

This pattern keeps UI feedback precise and user-friendly.

## Security

### CSRF protection – csurf

CSRF tokens are generated per session and injected into templates:

```js
app.use(csrfProtection);

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.locals.csrfToken = req.csrfToken();
    next();
});
```

Forms include \_csrf, and AJAX requests send it via headers:

```js
fetch("/admin/product/" + prodId, {
    method: "DELETE",
    headers: { "csrf-token": csrf },
});
```

This prevents cross-site request forgery attacks by requiring a valid token tied to the session.

### Access control middleware – is-auth

A minimal authorization guard:

```js
module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.session.isLoggedIn) return res.redirect("/login");
    next();
};
```

Used on protected routes: cart, checkout, product admin.

## File Uploads – multer

Product images are uploaded to a local `images/` directory.

```js
const fileStorage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, file, cb) => cb(null, "images"),
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        const safeDate = new Date()
            .toISOString()
            .replace(/:/g, "-")
            .replace(/\./g, "-");
        cb(null, `${safeDate}-${file.originalname}`);
    },
});
```

A strict filter allows only image MIME types:

```js
if (file.mimetype === "image/png" || file.mimetype === "image/jpg" || file.mimetype === "image/jpeg")
```

Deletion of old images on product update/delete is handled by a dedicated helper:

```js
fileHelper.deleteFile(product.imageUrl);
```

This prevents orphaned files and keeps storage consistent with DB state.

## Payments – Stripe Checkout

Checkout is implemented via Stripe-hosted payment pages (safer and simpler than handling card fields directly).

Flow:

- Server populates user cart products via Mongoose populate
- Creates a Stripe Checkout session with line_items
- Renders checkout page with sessionId + STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY

```js
return stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    mode: "payment",
    payment_method_types: ["card"],
    line_items: products.map((p) => ({
        quantity: p.quantity,
        price_data: {
            currency: "usd",
            unit_amount: Math.round(Number(p.productId.price) * 100),
            product_data: {
                name: p.productId.title,
                description: p.productId.description,
            },
        },
    })),
    success_url: `${req.protocol}://${req.get("host")}/checkout/success`,
    cancel_url: `${req.protocol}://${req.get("host")}/checkout/cancel`,
});
```

Important details:

- Prices are converted to cents (integer) – Stripe requirement
- success_url and cancel_url are dynamically generated for correct host/protocol

On success:

- order is created from cart snapshot
- cart is cleared

## PDF Invoices – pdfkit

Invoices are generated on demand and streamed:

- Content-Disposition: inline – displays in browser
- also saved to data/invoices/ for persistence

```js
const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument();
pdfDoc.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(invoicePath));
pdfDoc.pipe(res);
```

Design approach in your invoice implementation:

- page layout constants (margins, columns)
- helper functions like drawHr() and ensureSpace()
- computed totals and formatted money/date

This is a serious backend feature because it mixes:

- authorization (only owner can download)
- persistence concerns (file path management)
- streaming response behavior (no buffering entire PDF)

## Email – Nodemailer + SendGrid

Used for:

- signup success notification
- password reset email with token link

Transport is configured via SendGrid:

```js
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(
    sendgridTransport({ auth: { api_key: process.env.API_KEY } }),
);
```

Password reset uses crypto-secure token generation:

```js
crypto.randomBytes(32, (err, buffer) => {
    const token = buffer.toString("hex");
});
```

The token and expiration are stored in the user document:

- resetToken
- resetTokenExpiration

This is the standard secure flow:

1. user requests reset
2. receives one-time token with expiration
3. sets new password
4. token is cleared

## Client-Side Enhancements

The project includes JS for:

- deleting products via fetch() + CSRF header
- mobile navigation drawer interactions
- theme persistence in localStorage
- file input UX (show filename, mark invalid types)

Example: deleting a product without full page reload:

```js
fetch("/admin/product/" + prodId, {
    method: "DELETE",
    headers: { "csrf-token": csrf },
});
```

This gives a more modern admin UX while keeping the backend authoritative.

## Error Handling Strategy

Controllers use a consistent approach:

- if a promise chain fails – forward to error middleware
- dedicated 404 and 500 handlers

Example pattern:

```js
.catch(err => {
  const error = new Error(err);
  error.httpStatusCode = 500;
  next(error);
});
```

Global error middleware renders a 500 view and prevents silent failures.

## Dependency Rationale (Important Packages)

- **express** – web framework, routing, middleware composition
- **ejs** – SSR templates for HTML rendering
- **mongoose / mongodb** – MongoDB connection + ODM modeling and queries
- **express-session** – session management (server-side auth state)
- **connect-mongodb-session** – persistent session store in MongoDB
- **csurf** – CSRF protection for forms and unsafe HTTP verbs
- **connect-flash** – temporary one-request messages (auth errors, etc.)
- **express-validator** – validation, sanitization, predictable UI errors
- **bcryptjs** – secure password hashing and comparison
- **multer** – image upload pipeline + disk storage configuration
- **stripe** – payment flow using Checkout Sessions
- **pdfkit** – dynamic invoice PDF generation and HTTP streaming
- **nodemailer + nodemailer-sendgrid-transport** – transactional email sending
- **dotenv** – environment variable management for secrets/config
- **nodemon (dev)** – auto-restart during development

Also present but not core in the current MongoDB-first version:

- **sequelize + mysql2** – SQL layer module exists, useful if you evolve toward relational persistence or run hybrid storage

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Server runs on:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure:

- MongoDB connection variables are set
- Stripe keys are configured
- SendGrid API key is configured if you want email features
